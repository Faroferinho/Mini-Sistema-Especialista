Gascoigne was a priest in a foreign land, where he earned the title of "Father". At some point in his life, Gascoigne travelled to Yharnam and eventually joined the Healing Church as a hunter. From here, Gascoigne was partnered with Henryk, an older hunter. The two made an effective duo, and their partnership led to Henryk's 'tragically' long life.

At some point, Father Gascoigne took a wife by the name of Viola and the pair had children. As Gascoigne continued to hunt, he became affected by the bloodlust, forgetting even his family. Viola was known to play a Tiny Music Box, a memento of theirs, in order to draw him home when he had been out all night, helping him remember her and their children when he began succumbing to the bloodlust. Their daughter, the Young Girl, still resides in Central Yharnam, unless the Hunter sends her to Iosefka's Clinic, where she becomes a Celestial Minion, or Oedon Chapel, where she will be killed by the Maneater Boar. The Tiny Music Box will be given to the Hunter when speaking with the Young Girl and can be used against Father Gascoigne to stun him during battle.

During his final hunt, Gascoigne finally succumbed to the bloodlust, becoming little more than the beasts he had hunted. Viola left their home in order to search for her husband but forgot her music box. Her body is found in the Tomb of Oedon, near to where Gascoigne is hacking away at corpses until the Hunter puts him down. It is unclear whether he killed his wife or the beastly scourge did; nonetheless, her loss cost him his humanity.
