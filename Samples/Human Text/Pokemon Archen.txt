Archen is a dual-type Rock/Flying Fossil Pokémon introduced in Generation V.

It is revived from a Plume Fossil and evolves into Archeops starting at level 37.
Biology

Archen is a small, bipedal Pokémon with mixed reptilian and avian traits. Its large, red head is covered in discernible scales, and its neck has blue and red feathers. Its body is covered in untidy, sallow feathers, and it has blue, clawed wings. It has short, thin legs, and a twig-like tail that bears a diamond-shaped blue feather. It has wide white eyes with black pupils and no irises.

Archen is extinct but can be revived from fossils. It was originally believed to be the ancestor of all bird Pokémon, though recent research on this claim suggests otherwise. Its wings are small and cannot be used for flying; instead, Archen roost on trees, hop branch to branch, and glide through long distances to snatch prey. Archen is capable of jumping despite being unable to fly. In the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Archeops In The Modern World!, it was shown that Archen does not like Pokémon food but can grow a special plant with its cries. It enjoys the berries grown on this plant.

Archen and its evolved form, Archeops, are the only known Pokémon that can have Defeatist as an Ability.
