Audino is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.

While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Audino can Mega Evolve into Mega Audino using the Audinite.
Biology

Audino is a bipedal, pink-and-cream Pokémon with oval, blue eyes. The top of its head, its back, and arms are pink, while the lower half of its face, body, ears are cream-colored, as well as its front and fingers. The patterning of pink and cream on its chest resembles a jacket. There are three digits on its hands and two on its feet. It has a puffy, white tuft for a tail. Audino has floppy ears with thin, curled extensions on the underside. It can use these ears as radars, and it has an incredible hearing ability.

The feelers on its ears act like stethoscopes in that it can feel the beat of another Pokémon's heart, in order to assess the Pokémon's feelings and overall physical condition. The feelers are also able to determine when an Egg is close to hatching. It has an incredible sense of hearing, where it can even hear a rolling pebble from a mile away. Audino is said to have a kind heart.

Audino is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Secret Power by leveling up.
Forms

Audino can Mega Evolve into Mega Audino.

When Audino Mega Evolves into Mega Audino, it becomes both heavier and taller. The patterning on its stomach, now completely cream, is covered by what resembles a flared lab coat. Most of its body becomes white with pink tips in four places, one on each ear and near the edges of its "coat". Its eyes turn pink and its ears stand upright with longer, curlier feelers. Its tail becomes larger and a smaller tuft of fur is centered on its chest. Two additional, curled feelers extend from under this extra tuft of fur. White fur covers its feet with two small tufts on the heels. Mega Audino can release pulses that reduce hostility, and the secondary feelers can put those who come in contact with them into a deep sleep.[1]
