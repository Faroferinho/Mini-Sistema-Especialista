Biology

Cetitan is a large cetacean Pokémon. It has a white piscine body with large forelimbs and legs, and pink accents around its eyes, forepaws, and tail. The tail has two pairs of fins protruding from either side. Cetitan also has a gray underside with circular white accents, as well as gray accents on its armpits, and two large gray claws on each foot. It has five horns: two on the top of its head, and three around its large, wavy mouth. The singular horn on its upper jaw allows it to gather ice energy and freeze its surroundings.[1] When Cetitan opens its mouth, rows of long, teeth-like plates can be seen lining its jaws.

Cetitan has tough muscles, which allow it to support its weight and attack with immense physical power. It also has a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, which helps it migrate around snowy areas.[1] It lives in pods and shares habitats with Avalugg. As mentioned in Breathe Out, in Paldea, Cetitan mainly live on top of Glaseado Mountain, and their main diet consists of snow and ice. It's also mentioned that Cetitan can use echolocation to find and communicate with others of its kind through sound waves, and that the sounds it makes is said to be similar to that of a flute. In Ice Battle! Cold-Eyed Grusha, Cetitan is shown to be able to slide around ice and snow on its belly to move faster across said terrain.

Cetitan and its pre-evolved form, Cetoddle, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Ice Spinner by leveling up.
