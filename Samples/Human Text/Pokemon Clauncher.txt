Clauncher is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VI.

It evolves into Clawitzer starting at level 37.
Biology

Clauncher is a crustacean Pokémon that resembles a bright blue shrimp. It has three pairs of light gray legs; two pairs have simple blue spikes, while the foremost pair forms a larger set of claws. The left claw forms a single, sharp point; while the right claw is much larger and forms a more traditional pincer, with a tiny yellow lower claw and a yellow circular pattern with two stripes on the back. Each front claw has a black stripe across the top. It has a pair of yellow antennae on top of its head, yellow eyes, and three pointed mandibles. There are three black stripes along its back that separate its body into segments, and it has a light gray underside. Two black, rectangular fins form its tail.

Clauncher's large right claw gives it a poor sense of balance and makes it difficult to swim straight. Instead, it moves by firing compressed water from this claw. This is achieved through controlled expulsions of internal gas. Additionally, it uses this ability to shoot down flying prey and can shatter rock at close range. It is an adept user of aura-based attacks.

Occasionally, Clauncher's claws will fall off, causing it to go into hiding until the claws grow back. The meat inside its claws is said to be delicious; however, it has a characteristic taste that is not universally loved. Clauncher's claws are a popular delicacy in places like Galar and Paldea. Dreepy is known to bite on Clauncher, although it does not actually feed on them; this is said to be a behavior carried over from when the Dreepy was alive.

From Generation VIII onward, Clauncher and its evolved form, Clawitzer, are the only known Pokémon that can have Mega Launcher as an Ability.
