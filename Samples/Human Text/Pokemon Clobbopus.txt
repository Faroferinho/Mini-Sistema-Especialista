Clobbopus is a Fighting-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.

It evolves into Grapploct when leveled up while knowing Taunt.
Biology

Clobbopus is a small, beige cephalopod Pokémon. It has a rather large head with six orange spots on the top, an orange mask-shaped pattern on the face, and a small, orange siphon on the left side. It has small, blue eyes with horizontal, slit-shaped pupils. Clobbopus has six small tentacles that it uses to get around, and two large tentacles that act as arms. These large tentacles have rounded indigo bumps on each end, resembling boxing gloves. Each of the tentacles are lined with orange suction cups. Clobbopus's underside is indigo and contains its mouth, which is circular in shape and has two sharp beak-like protrusions.

Clobbopus has easily torn tentacles, which allow it to escape from predators; these tentacles can be regrown later. Its intelligence is comparable to that of a three-year-old human. It is a very curious creature and often investigates things by punching them with its tentacles. It normally lives underwater, but is known to surface onto land to search for food.
