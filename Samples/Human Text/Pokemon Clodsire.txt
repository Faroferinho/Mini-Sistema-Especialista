Clodsire is a dual-type Poison/Ground Pokémon introduced in Generation IX.

It evolves from Paldean Wooper starting at level 20.
Biology

Clodsire is a quadrupedal, amphibious Pokémon, with a rounded body that is dark brown on the top and light brown on the bottom, forming a wave pattern in the middle. It has black beady eyes, a large mouth, and a pair of tiny nostrils. Its four legs are rounded and have three digits each. A short dorsal fin delineates its lower back and ends at its stout, bulbous tail. Clodsire shares many similarities with its non-Paldean relative, Quagsire.

On top of Clodsire's back are six light purple circular spots. If Clodsire is attacked, it will retaliate by sticking out large, thick, light purple spines from these spots—a dangerous and risky move. Clodsire lives in the depths of ponds and swamps, and helps Paldean Wooper cross waters by carrying them on its back. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Clodsire can rarely be found sleeping in the mud; it is theorized that this is because Clodsire became sleepy after carrying Paldean Wooper through the water.
