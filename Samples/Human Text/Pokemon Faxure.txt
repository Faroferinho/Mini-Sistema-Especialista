Fraxure is a Dragon-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.

It evolves from Axew starting at level 38 and evolves into Haxorus starting at level 48.
Biology

Fraxure is a bipedal, draconic Pokémon with long, gray tusks with red tips protruding from the sides of its mouth. These tusks are capable of breaking boulders. It has dark eyes with red irises, a gray face, and a cowl-like feature of green segments on its head, neck, back, and chest. Its arms have three red fingers, and its lower body is gray, with red speckles on the underbelly. It has red toes and a red tip on its tail.

Fraxure is very violent and territorial. Fights over turf often break out between it and another Fraxure. After a fight, it sharpens its tusks on river rocks, as they do not regenerate. It lives alongside rivers. Fraxure engages in violent confrontations with Bisharp for the locations of sharping stones. Fraxure uses its tusks only when necessary. The reason is once its tusks break, Fraxure will be unable to use it again. Fraxure uses its tusks to cut the prey in two different food portions, one for eating now and the second portion for later.
