Floragato is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IX.

It evolves from Sprigatito starting at level 16 and evolves into Meowscarada starting at level 36.
Biology

Floragato is a bipedal, feline Pokémon. Its body is mostly covered in long light green fur, with green ear tips and a short fluffy tail. It has a growth of green fur-like leaves on its neck,[1] which extends at the front and droops down to its hips, resembling a poncho. Dark green colorations adorn the lower part of this neck fur, along with its hands, feet, and face; the latter is patterned to resemble a mask. Its face also has pink eyes and a small pink nose. Floragato's fur can change in hardness depending on its mood — its fur becomes sharp as needles when it is ready to battle. Each of its hands and feet has a round, pink paw pad and three digits, with visible claws on its fingers.

There is a vine tucked inside Floragato's fur — which has a hard, round, visible pink flower bud on the end, acting similarly to a boutonnière. Floragato wields the vine and swings the bud to attack its opponents.[2] In Pokémon Horizons: The Series, the vines can be used to pull others towards Floragato and even knock off objects held by other Pokémon. The bud additionally can be used for its entertainment as a yo-yo. When not in use, the bud is kept on the left side of Floragato's chest, near its neck. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Floragato plays with the bud while sleeping. Floragato is intelligent and dexterous. It is also mischievous and likes showing off, desiring attention and companionship from others. If its Trainer refuses to give it attention, Floragato may misbehave by pulling pranks, such as tying the Trainer with its vine while they are asleep.[2]
