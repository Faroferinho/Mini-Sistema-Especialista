Noibat is a dual-type Flying/Dragon Pokémon introduced in Generation VI.

It evolves into Noivern starting at level 48.
Biology

Noibat is a pale purple bat-like Pokémon. It has yellow eyes with black pupils and black creases within them, a black triangular marking on the inner corner of each eye, three tufts of spiked fur on each cheek, two dark purple teardrop-shaped spots on the front of its face forming the shape of a nose-leaf, a black lower jaw, and two spiked tufts of fur on its upper lip. Its large, teardrop-shaped ears resemble loudspeakers; they are dark purple on the outside with alternating rings of pale and dark purple fading to black on the inside. Fluffy black fur covers its chest and hips. On the middle joint of its wings are small black hands with two fingers, and it has two long toes on each foot.

Noibat can be found in pitch black caves. They rest in the caves during the day and only leave during the night. From its large ears, it is capable of emitting any kind of wavelength of sound, including ultrasonic waves of up to 200,000 Hertz; no wavelength is beyond its ability to emit. It uses these waves to stun large creatures, communicate with other Noibat, and immobilize prey.[1] It also uses ultrasonic waves to perceive its surroundings, allowing it to fly in the dark. It is very fond of fruits, and uses its sonar to detect its ripeness. It tends to mistake Applin and Flapple (according to Noibat’s picture in the Paldea Pokédex) for its food.
