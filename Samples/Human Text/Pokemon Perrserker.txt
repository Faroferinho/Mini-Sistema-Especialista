Perrserker is a Steel-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.

It evolves from Galarian Meowth starting at level 28.
Biology

Perrserker is a bipedal feline Pokémon. Unlike Persian, Perrserker remains bipedal and has a body shape similar to what it had as a Meowth. The hair on its head and parts of its limbs have hardened into natural armor. The former takes the shape of a stereotypical horned Viking helmet that covers its ears and part of its eyes while also incorporating its coin. Perrserker's claws have grown longer and harder as well and can come together to form daggers that it can use to fight its foes more effectively.

Perrserker has a violent and barbaric demeanor, and it lives for the thrill of battle. It and Persian have a relationship characterized by mutual disdain on account of the irreconcilable differences in their respective temperaments.

Perrserker and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up. Perrserker is also the only known Pokémon that can have Steely Spirit as its Ability.
