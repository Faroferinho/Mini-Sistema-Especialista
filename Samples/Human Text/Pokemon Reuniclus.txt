Reuniclus is a Psychic-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.

It evolves from Duosion starting at level 41. It is the final form of Solosis.
Biology

Reuniclus is a pale green Pokémon surrounded by a blob of translucent, green gelatinous substance. It has a large, round head with a thin stripe down the center. Its eyes are black and oval, while its mouth is red and triangular. Its body is small with stubby arms and legs. However, there are several round objects floating next to its arms. These objects increase in size and darken in color the further they are from the body and form arm-like appendages. The gel around these appendages forms three-fingered hands. Above its head, two rounded, triangular objects are suspended in the gel, giving the impression of horns or ears. The gel forms a stubby, round tail at the base of Reuniclus's body.

Reuniclus controls its powerful arms using psychic powers. It can form a network with the brains of other Reuniclus by clasping hands with them. It is said that the power of Reuniclus is so great, it can crush boulders psychokinetically. Although capable of using its psychic powers in battle, Reuniclus prefers to use its large arms to pummel opponents. Drinking the liquid covering Reuniclus's body is said to grant wisdom; however, the liquid is extremely toxic.
