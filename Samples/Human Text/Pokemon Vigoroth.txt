Vigoroth is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.

It evolves from Slakoth starting at level 18 and evolves into Slaking starting at level 36.
Biology

Vigoroth is a white, sloth-like, bipedal Pokémon with a teardrop-shaped tuft of red fur on its forehead. It has stubby ears, two small, triangular teeth in each jaw, a brown lower jaw, and large eyes encircled by brown rings. There are two stripes on its back, which are also brown. Its arms are long, and its hands and feet have two sharp black claws. The undersides of its hands and feet have circular red pads, and its rear also has a baboon-like patch of red. The fur on its chest, tail, and sides of its maw are shaggy.

Vigoroth's heart beats ten times faster than it did as a Slakoth, and as such, it cannot sit still for even a minute. Attempting to stand still or sleep raises its stress level and agitates its blood. It likes to go berserk by spinning its arms to destroy anything in its path. It runs wild through the jungle. Due to its rampages, it is always hungry. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, despite Vigoroth appearing to be fast alseep at first glance, it is unable to sleep deeply.[1]
