birdbox actually fucking traumatized me i am so so SO upset by people hurting/killing themselves that my heart was pounding and i was legit sweating the whole movie. my mom kept telling me to just stop watching and after it ended my mom and sister were both like “that was a horrible pointless movie” and im sitting in my seat bawling my eyes out as if i had just had a traumatic experience and was finally breaking down.

my sis is like “jill wtf u were actually scared?” And my mom is like “YES she HATES people hurting themselves her body is like in fight or flight mode rn” and my sis is like “then why did she wanna finish it????”

the answer is the same as for all of us: we thought there would be a plot but no. there was no purpose except to give you anxiety and fear and to include senseless violence. no explanation for anything, no satisfaction, no anything rewarding for sitting through horrible scenes.

im mad and still crying and my chest hurts from my heart pounding fuck this movie
