I just watched Owl House the other day and it was freakin awesome. Truly a master piece.
I also watched Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous, and tbh it wasn’t that bad. I got super into it haha. It had good plot and the characters were very interesting. And i guess it took the disappointment of not getting another movie in the series away for now. I was SUPER excited about the new Jurassic World: Dominoin movie after Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. I have been waiting for THREE YEARS FOR THAT ONE MOVIE (it may not seem like much but that is a long time for someone like me XD). Now I gotta wait another year which will probably take forever.

At least I’ll be looking forward to other things now. A possible Detective Pikachu 2 movie (not official but I’m hoping for one), Owl House season 2, a possible Sonic the Hedgehog movie (I MEAN COME ON THEY CAN’T LEAVE US ON THAT ENDING-), as well as a FNAF movie (which could take several years-)

Anyway sorry bout the rant I am just obsessed with Jurassic Park, and I had been waiting a long time to watch Owl House (pretty much a year lol). Good night/morning to all.
(now don’t mind me just gonna rewatch the Dragon Prince now- ba-bye)
