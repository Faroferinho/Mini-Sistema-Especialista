Oh boy you can really tell this season's fucked up production played a major part in why ddba is so... broken

I actually really liked a couple of the 10 or so plot threads that could have easily been great single season storylines but instead got mangled up into some of the most contrived writing choices I've ever seen on television

And not to mention the incredibly one-note characters who got next to no development and serve as poor replacements for the original trio and dynamics we've spent three seasons growing to care about

In the end, it all leads up to a lackluster finale where practically nothing happens and there is no payoff for just about any of the loose ends scattered throughout the season

I hope season 2 is better... I hope
