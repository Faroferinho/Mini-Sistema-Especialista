Can we go back to when Superboy had zip to do with Lex Luthor? Plz? He was such a deep character and his creation was so much more morally confusing because like on one hand they were just trying to protect people but on the other hand they cloned someone without their consent after they died for the express purpose of making said clone become a weapon (even if they didn’t think of him as a weapon).

Isn’t that so much better!? And then add in Superman coming back and Superboy being pushed to the side and being thought of as like, redundant or unneeded. But he doesn’t hate anybody for what’s happening to him and literally no one involved had bad intentions but still the result is a kid alone in the world and trying to find his place when he had been created, shaped, molded, for a place that isn’t there anymore. No one was evil, no one wanted to hurt Superboy, but he was created in unfortunate circumstances and then he slipped through the cracks and no one felt it was their responsibility to parent him.

Like why would Lex even clone Superman? It’s completely out of character and goes against his goals? He distrusts Superman for having so much power. He’s racist against aliens and thinks humanity needs to stand on their own with out relying on someone who, in his mind, has no loyalty to them. He wants to make humans (himself) more powerful than Superman, no create another Superman under his control! Ughhhhhhh.

Can comics just rewind back to like right before 2000?
