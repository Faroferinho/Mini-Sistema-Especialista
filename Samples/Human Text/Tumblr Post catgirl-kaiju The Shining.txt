Honestly, I think any director who hurts their actors physically or psychologically because they don't trust them to, y'know, ACT is a hack. No movie is worth hurting someone or allowing someone to be hurt. Like, I like The Shining a lot. It's very creepy and tense, and Wendy Carlos' score is great. But, frankly, I think the film would have been much better if Stanley Kubrick hadn't decided to psychologically torture Shelly Duvall and just trusted her to do the thing he hired her to do.

As it is, Duvall's performance is noticeably stiff because of how terrified she is on set and that's on Kubrick. Not to mention, even if a version of the film made without hurting Shelly Duvall was legitimately worse, a director's vision is no excuse to be cruel. Part of a director's job is working with and directing the actors. You need to be able to work with people, and when you would rather hurt your actors than talk to them you are revealing a deep incompetence in how to do your job.
