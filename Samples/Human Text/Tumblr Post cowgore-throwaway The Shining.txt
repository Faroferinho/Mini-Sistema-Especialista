Apparently, there are some people who think a certain scene in Kubrick's "The Shining" is unrealistic. I'm referring to the scene at the end of Jack frozen in the hedge maze. These people think the amount of snow that fell on him is more than what would have fallen in one night. Let me say... those people have never experienced a midwest winter. I've had snows that blocked the door to my house. The Shining is meant to take place Colorado, in the MOUNTAINS. Seriously... like, it used to snow more back then because global warming, but it's still a lot.
