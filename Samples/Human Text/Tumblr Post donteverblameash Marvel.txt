Hey, so, I'm about to go on a random senseless rant at 7:14 am. while I'm getting ready for school to talk about Marvel ships, just be warned about who you're reading at the moment.

Stucky love and Sambucky love, to me, are quite different. Not less valid, not less romantic, not less than at all they're just different.

For Sambucky, they seem more... stable. Figured out. They love each other, and they both know it. They're there for each other all the time without having to physically be next to the other all the time. We saw them grow and grow up into these men who just have so much care and respect to one another. Their love just has the feeling of waking up next to each other and peppering kisses on the others neck and breakfast together talking about work. They chill out in their offices together and pick their nephews up from school.

On the other hand, Steve and Bucky love seems... starved. They didn't say they loved one another. We just know they did. But the world kept tearing them apart and then bringing them back together. They lost so much time. So, their love feels more like just stay with me and never go, heated kisses, pulling tugging, and begging for more because they can't lose each other again, they're a package deal, never apart because they both aren't stable, Bucky said it himself that he was "Semi-stable" they can't be apart or they break

Idk. Hope that makes sense.
