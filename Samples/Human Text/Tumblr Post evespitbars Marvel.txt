Not anyone can be under the mask

Augh nobody understands how the spiderman is essentially born from sacrifice and loneliness. The reason he became spiderman in the first place was because uncle ben died.

 He got his powers cause he went to the science fair alone/got seperated from the group tour and got bit by the spider. Sure peter has people, but thats it. Theyre people hes close to, those whom he can confide in, but no one truly understands the struggle, watching people DIE because you were too late, watching your girlfriend fall to her death because of YOU.

Having to sacrifice your mairriage to save your last only blood relative left, having been killed ans revived multiple times because your this universes sick little fun play thing. He has all these reasons to become a truly terrible person, yet he doesnt.

He doesnt get to be selfish. 

Only time he really is selfish is when he gets the symbiote, which originally is supposed to amplify his emotions and his desires, and even then he was still helping others, even though he was percieved as 'going rogue'

EVEN IN THE ORIGINAL COMICS WHEN HE SIGNS UP TO BE JJJS PHOTOGRAPHER OF SPIDERMAN, ITS TO SELL PICS TO HIM TO HELP AUNT MAY W THE RENT !!!

 loneliness is the one thing that makes and breaks spiderman.
