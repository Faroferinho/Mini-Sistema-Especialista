okay but if you were gonna permanently kill off deathstroke i feel the writer to do it should've been christopher priest. i'm a firm believer that he's his best writer and joshua truly cannot write his character. my thing with joshua is that he thinks he's THAT guy for killing him off but like... you had to make him something he is not and jeopardize other characters development/characterization.

 slade could give less of a fuck about the multiverse and the idea of a dark one at that. slade is a mercenary who has a lot of ego and enjoys money. that's it. nothing more. he was extremely out of character for the lazarus and dark multiverse event. also, going back to what i said earlier why tf did they villainize geo-force for the sake of the plot ? and why minimize jericho and adeline's importance and primarily focus on rose. the fact that they said adeline was in hiding when all that shit went down... this is the same woman who hired BOTH batman and superman to take his ass out. best believe she would be on the front lines when she isn't weak in the knees. a lot of shit just truly doesn't add up and i feel like joshua in general just kinda depends on nostalgia and fan service. and no, i'm not completely mad that slade has been killed off just more so how he was killed off with such shit writing.
