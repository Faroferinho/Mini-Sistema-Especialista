Omori
SPOILER WARNING

I finished story on the good ending! Felt such a catharsis when OMORI was fighting against himself talking destructive things.

This game fully gave the feeling of having great loyal friends.

And forgiving yourself even when you have done reaaaly great shit.

It was hard to play, but for a person with suicidal tendencies like me it was what I needed to hear.

The dream world of OMORI is interesting, though I was sometimes tired of getting to know strange creatures there. But it really made a feeling it is a dream with all this weird stuff.

I am watching Adventure time rn, for some reason this two project have the same vibe.

Creators of OMORI, thank you for making such a good game. That is something I would like to do or even better. My great respect to you!
