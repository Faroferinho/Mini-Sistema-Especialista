Does anyone else think about how in the What If…? show Peggy is Steve Rogers, and Steve Rogers is her Bucky (literally, he becomes an evil assassin, it just happens a bit differently). How when it’s Peggy and Steve of course that dynamic is romantic and not platonic, like everyone says MCU Steve and Bucky’s relationship is. That when it’s Captain Carter and Steve, it’s romantic that she snaps him out of his brainwashing by refusing to fight him (willing to die), but when it’s Steve and Bucky that’s just “the power of friendship.”

When I say, “Would that ship be canon if it was a man and a woman?” this is what I mean. Steve and Bucky had a very romantic dynamic, but it was never pursued because they were both men.

(to be clear, it’s fine not to ship Stucky, I’m just mad at everyone who acted like there was no reason to ship them when clearly there was. & that the MCU would have put them together if it was a straight couple)
