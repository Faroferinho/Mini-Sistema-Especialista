Spiderman fans come back to crash me out once more

LISTEN, LOOK AT ME

LOOK ME IN MY EYES

I will FOREVER stand that I enjoy the iterations where Spiderman has ironman has a mentor and that he is a fan of him, or ANY mentor for that fact. I do believe some universes like ultimate (both comics and the series), or the MCU, has its flaws like taking away a bit of Peter's independence, I think it's also important to realize how important him having a mentor is as it's to help him come to the grips that he deserves to have help, he deserves to have someone looking out for him, he doesn't have to be alone. That and I lot of it is really wholesome to see him have other people in his life he can look up to and rely on.

AND YET, THE FANS WHO GET UPSET ABOUT THE WRITERS TORTURING HIM BY MAKING HIM ALONE ALL THE TIME THEN START COMPLAINING THE SECOND THIS MAN GETS A MENTOR FIGURE BECAUSE "HE HAS TO DO IT ALL ON HIS OWN" AND "ITS NOT LIKE THE 616 COMICS"

PICK A LANE HOLY CHEESE WAX

I AGREE HE SHOULD MAKE HIS OWN TECH BUT I DON'T THINK HE NEEDS TO BE ALONE EITHER

DO YOU WANT HIM TO BE ALONE IN CONSTANT SUFFERING OR DO YOU WANT HIM TO HAVE HELP

I will forever stand by the fact that the biggest enemy to Spider-Man more than the writers is the fans themselves

OH AND BTW STOP PUTTING THE 616 UNIVERSE ON A PEDESTAL, I DON'T WANT THAT UNIVERSE HERE, I DON'T NEED NO MORE ONE MORE DAY OR ANY OF THAT YA'LL KEEP IGNORING EXISTS IN THAT UNIVERSE.

LET IT STAY BURIED. LET HIM REST. YOU KEEP WANTING TO BRING IT BACK LIKE THE WRITERS DO, WHILE COMPLAINING THEY NEVER LET IT REST, YOU ARE LITERALLY CREATING A SELFFUFILLING PROPHECY OH MY LORD-
