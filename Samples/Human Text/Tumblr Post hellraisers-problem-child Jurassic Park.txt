Jurassic Park (book) spoilers below. I dunno maybe someone hasn't read it yet and wants to

"Get my grandkids back here! Now!" John Hammond â€“

John "There are no problems" Hammond is doing my fucking head in. Literally the whole time, the WHOLE  time everyone is telling him how bad an idea this is. Even Wu, THE scientist that made the dinosaurs is like "John we need to maybe make the dinosaurs PG rated" and Hammond is like "but that's not real! I want people to see real dinosaurs!" And Wu is like "yeah but none of our equipment can catch or tranquilize them, the dinosaurs are too fast." Like Muldoon was going on and on about how he wanted military grade weapons to take out the dinosaurs in case of emergency. Ian Malcolm said before the dinosaurs were even made that it would be a disaster simply because of what Hammond was trying to do.

This book genuinely is one big "don't fuck with nature" story and I love it.

I also genuinely love the way Crichton explains the scientific bits: so easy to follow and understand but I don't feel like it's being dumbed down for me, I'm being spoken to like an intelligent adult. It's really nice considering there are a lot of scientist tirades throughout the book.

Anyway, as everyone has been saying, everything has turned to shit. Tbf Nedry did actually fuck it all up by turning off the power to the security, so he could steal from InGen to sell the embryos to BioSyn , but you know what's really fucked? Nedry actually designed the park to have a fatal flaw with the security system so they'd always call him and no one else. So when he turned the security off, it shut ALL the security features off on the park. That's how the Trex got out, because Dennis Nedry turned the fences off. His death is far more gruesome in the book, but he makes much less sound I think.

Anyway this is a wicked book but FUCK John Hammond (not in the fun way)
