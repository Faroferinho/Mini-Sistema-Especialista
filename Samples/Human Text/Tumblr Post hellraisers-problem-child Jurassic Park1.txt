Okay I have some gripes about the start of the first book. We got some Jurassic Park: Lost World spoilers coming. I guess?

The way humans and mammals are explained separately... I mean the year this was written we definitely knew we were mammals, right?

And then to say mammals HAD a lifespan of a million years. What do you mean HAD?! I? Because mammals have definitely had longer than 4 million to evolve, they've been around for a lot longer I'm sure of it. Oh gosh I'm gonna go down another evolution rabbit hole again aren't I?

Also Ian Malcolm spitting just straight shit about how the dinosaurs might have gone extinct and then settling on: it's a fault in their behaviour. Like no? Complex species can become extinct simply because the world no longer supports them, we've seen it happen before. Behaviour can be a large factor but not the factor. I don't think that was the message Crichton was trying to convey but Malcolm certainly waffled as usual (I'm pretty sure it's a flashback scene too).

Anyway I don't know why that annoyed me but humans are mammals come ON
