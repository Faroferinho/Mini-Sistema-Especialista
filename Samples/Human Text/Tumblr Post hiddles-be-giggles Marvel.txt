If I see one more picture of Loki or Tom where they have completely erased that man’s wrinkles/smile lines and made him look like a fucking baby, I’m gonna RAGEEEEE!!!! If yall can’t accept and love that man for his mature face, you need to get over yourself!! He has lines!! He’s not a fucking baby!! Let him look his age! He is perfect, every single line is a blessing. Let. People. Age. He is aging and he’s aging gracefully!! That is ALL.
