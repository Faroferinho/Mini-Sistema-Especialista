I can't fathom the fact that some people watch a movie, show or read a book they like and they just go: "I liked it :)" and that's it....girl how?? Whenever I like a movie, tv show, book or musical I need to inhale that piece of media like it's air, I need to self insert myself in it and create an elaborate plot line for my character in it, then I listen to music that reminds me of the piece of media and think of it 24/7, while obsessively rewatching scenes and analyzing every bit of it till I notice details nobody has seen, finally, I try to convince people to watch it with me so that I can experience it for the first time through them. Then my obsession dies and I feel empty until the next one comes along..... and you're telling me people can enjoy something and just...go to sleep and not think of it again????

I’ve honestly started realizing most ppl don’t watch or play things repeatedly like I do. I literally make quizzes over on Quotev and the questions seem so obvious to me but end up being difficult for the majority. And I’m sitting there like “oh, right, not everyone rewatches the same thing over and over again like me.” I mean, if I had a dollar for every single time I watched one of the six Jurassic Park movies, I’d be rich. No joke. I’ve memorized most of the script at this point. And it never gets old.

I think about my comfort characters 24/7 and they bring me a sense of joy and wonder that reality just can’t match sometimes. I literally do not know what people think about all day if it isn’t daydreaming about ocs or fandom stuff. You mean to tell me that imagining my ocs/favorite canon characters every time I listen to music isn’t normal??? I think about them in class too and it’s so distracting. 😭😭😭

I literally do feel a gaping hole whenever something new in my favorite fandoms are past. When G x K New Empire came out, I literally told my parents “Wow, I feel empty now” after seeing it. The movie was fantastic and amazing and I could rant about it for hours, but I was just so happy and wanting to chat about it with them that I was also partially upset that I’ve already experienced it. I didn’t really know what to look forward to since most of my current fandom updates were months away. And it doesn’t really help that I try and get my friends to experience my fandoms, but… it never really works out. So I’m just kinda vibing on the internet trying to find people as weird and passionate as me.
