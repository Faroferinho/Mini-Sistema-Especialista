I promised myself I wouldn't let the MCU hurt me anymore but I cannot tell you how angry I am about them casting RDJ as Dr. Doom.

Look, I respect RDJ as an actor. I think he's got some serious chops and is good at what he does. but he does not have what it takes to play Victor von fucking Doom.

Dr. Doom is the ultimate comic book villain. He's a conniving schemer who fucks around and finds out on a daily basis. He's a grandiose and epic Wagnerian antagonist. He's a Saturday morning cartoon character. He's literally prophesied to be the only person who can bring lasting peace to the world as its conquering king.

You can't just give a role like that to someone like RDJ who, while a good actor, is not suited to that role. The only person who can pull of Doom is either a classically trained Shakespeare performer or a community theater amateur.
