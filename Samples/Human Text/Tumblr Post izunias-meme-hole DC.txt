How has this guy never got utilized in any adaptations? WHY has nobody utilized him more? A demon who works as a media mogul is fckin' extremely on the nose, but it's such a good idea for a Superman villain that combines an otherworldly foe with an extremely real type of evil. You don't have to make him the actual devil, you could at least make him an evil sorcerer like how he was Pre-Crisis while maintaining that second life as a media mogul he had Post-Crisis. Either way WHY IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA FOR A SUPERMAN VILLAIN CURRENTLY IN OBSCURE COMIC HELL?!
