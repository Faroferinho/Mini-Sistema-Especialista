My Love and mostly hate for X-Men: First Class explained, aka, what this huge X-Men Fan calls the worst X-Men movie of all time(lol)

back in 2011 when X-Men: First Class was released, me and my sister decided to watch it on dvd rental release, naturally, whenever an interesting movie comes along, especially something that we've always been a fan of ever since childhood, we like to give things a shot, no harm done right?
well, you would think(lol)
X-Men: First Class is what I personally consider to be the worst X-Men movie, number one, it's directed by matthew vaughn, whom I personally detest because the asshole is an obvious dinosaur misogynist and misandrist, that's right, typical stupid Hollywood director that views both genders through a completely trashy and sexist lense and pretends to care about both genders, but I digress, so yeah, the director is an asshole, number 2, jennifer lawrence is a terrible and disgusting actress(that's a conversation for another time lol), number 3, most of the young mutants in this movie are dumb asses I couldn't give 2 shits about, number 4, Kevin Bacon who is a good actor ended up playing one of the worst and cheesy villains of all time(and not the good type of cheesy), his performance was just bad and brutal and felt like alot like an Austin Powers villain only you weren't laughing because this stupid movie wasn't a parody, although it sure as hell feels like one, a really bad one
this movie has too many fucking flaws to count, the forced heterosexuality of Charles Xavier, who is obviously a Gay Man, he's the Harvey Milk of the X-Men for crying out loud
I need to talk about the highlights/the good things about this movie now

1.) James McAvoy as Charles Xavier

ever since I was a fan of the original X-Men growing up, I was always curious to see who they'd get to play a young Charles, when they cast James McAvoy, I fell head over heels in love with the guy, he's a beautiful Scottish actor who often plays British characters and he has the natural sensitivity and compassion of Charles Xavier, his portrayal although at times suffered some mild cringe, was still a stellar and beautiful young portrayal of the leader of the X-Men, McAvoy's performance of Xavier was at it's best in X-Men: Days Of Future Past, I honestly think he should've been nominated for a BAFTA for that performance, his performance was so good and beautiful that everytime I rewatch that X-Men movie, I'm in tears because he put his entire soul into that performance, you believe that this compassionate man is at his lowest point, you see a man who loves others so much but now he's at rock bottom and now he needs help from the greatest X-Man of all time(Logan Howlett aka "The Wolverine"), but I digress
James McAvoy as Charles Xavier is one of the biggest highlights of this film for me
it angers me that they could've went further with the Civil Rights Allegories of the 1960s and 1970s, to me Charles Xavier has always been a cross between Martin Luther King Jr and Harvey Milk, both men were great leaders and were both pacifists, they wanted equal rights for everyone and didn't view violence as the answer and both were also killed because of their brave views
what this movie missed was the opportunity to make Charles Xavier into a canon Gay Rights Leader
to all us of X-Men Fans all over the world, majority of us have always assumed that Charles Xavier was a gay man, we could read in between the lines that he once had a romantic relationship with Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto, the man who is now his "enemy",
did anyone really buy that cheap ass fuck scene in the bar where Charles was trying to pick up a random woman? you call that flirting? I call that forcing a gay character to say stupid hetero things that they would never say in their lives unless they were deeply closeted
the entire time, throughout the whole movie, you can just feel the sexual/romantic tension between both Charles and Erik, these 2 men are head over heels in love with each other, but their views are so conflicting that it causes them to fight and not have a chance of being together/having a healthy romantic relationship
it's a tragedy, it's good story telling but it's also tragic
Charles and Erik are Gay and always have been, they're a tragic gay couple that can't be together because their beliefs aren't uniting them

2.) Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr

X-Men: First Class is the first time I've ever seen Michael Fassbender in a role and my God was he the perfect choice to be a young Erik Lehnsherr
honestly, without Michael and James' performances, this movie would completely fall apart and I think most people wouldn't even remember it
their chemistry is amazing, you actually believe that these 2 guys are head over heels in love with each other but because of their beliefs they just can't seem to find a middle ground with each other
their relationship is almost like Israel and Palestine, only Charles isn't dropping bombs

3.) Hugh Jackman's short Logan cameo

"go fuck yourself", only an icon can say those words and have everyone go wild, everyone knows that an X-Men movie without Logan isn't an X-Men movie worth watching
Logan aka Wolverine is our 80s action star when it comes to the X-Men Franchise, it's like watching a Terminator movie without a call-back or cameo from Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T-800 aka Uncle Bob
I'll admit, when I heard that Hugh Jackman was reprising his role as Wolverine for Deadpool 3, I knew my butt would be in that seat in the theatre, I was like, okay, you got my attention, I love Wolverine, he was basically my sexual awakening at a very young age, I just didn't realize it at the time
so yeah, if it's an X-Men movie, you gotta have Wolfie

4.) That Take That Song that plays in the end credits of the movie

Love Love by Take That is a masterpiece of a song, it actually also fits the theme of the movie perfectly, almost like it's being sung from Charles' perspective
perfect band, perfect song, perfect movie idea, just a movie that has so many fucking problems

now, back to what made this movie so bad

it looked like they were catering to stupid people
it feels almost insulting to our intelligence
Super Hero Fans aren't stupid, we're actually very intelligent and we love good stories that have a positive impact
Stan Lee created the X-Men for the outsiders of society, the oppressed, Mixed Races, LGBT, people with disabilities and so on
so the fact that this movie was catered to a dumb hetero male audience is completely insulting
Gay Men and Gay Women make up a huge part of the X-Men fandom, and don't forget the Bisexuals either as well as others,
this movie could've dealt with and could've shown what life was like for Gay People in the 1960s and the 1970s, they could've made the parallels between Charles Xavier and Harvey Milk,
could you imagine a storyline where Charles becomes the first Gay mayor of New York in early 1970s?
that would've been really epic to see on film and it would've been really heartfelt and revolutionary
this movie lacks a soul, it has heart in some parts, but it caters to an audience that doesn't know what it feels like to be hated on simply for being just you
heterosexual men aren't killed everyday just for being hetero men, Gay Men and Trans Men and Trans Women however are victims of violent attacks everyday, society still hates us for something we have no control over
I know this got long and turned into a big rant about LGBT Rights and issues but I digress, that's another conversation for another time
but this movie really pisses me off, it had the potential to be one of the greatest X-Men movies ever made but because of a retarded director, the movie lost it's soul along the way
