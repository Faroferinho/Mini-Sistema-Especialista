Y'know what I hate?

Spideypool shippers who say "Wade would've totally bullied Peter if they went to highschool together" like it's funny or cute

Like... ???

Clearly, you've never been bullied, and never read the comics, because only someone who's super fuckin ignorant would say that shit

- bullying is fucking serious shit. I was bullied as a teen and y'know what? I still have nightmares about these people. I saw one of my old bullies a year ago during an event and I had a fucking panic attack and had to hide in another room to calm down. Last thing I'd ever wanna do is fuck one of my bullies, I don't give a shit how hot they may be, they made me feel like trash for existing, I ain't stupid

- Wade was also bullied as a kid in some comic continuity because he liked girly things. So if you take that canon, he obviously wouldn't then become a bully to some poor kid who's just trying to exist

- Wade kills abusers and assholes for a living, if anything he'd bully the bullies, not the fuckin victims. If he saw highschool Peter Parker, last thing he'd do is bully him. Fuck he'd probably just become his goddamn bodyguard if anything lmao

Like "haha wouldn't it be funny if Peter and Wade's first interaction was Wade shoving Peter into a locker" no actually that'd just be really sad
