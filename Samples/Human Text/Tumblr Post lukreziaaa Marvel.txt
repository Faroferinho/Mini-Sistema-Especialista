Honestly, I find kind of hilarious the amount of people that praises the new superman for his message and then immediately says some dumb shit that completely goes against it.

You can’t go on socials without seeing dozens of (very nice) videos about how these summer (adjacent, Thunderbolts* came out in May) superhero films are telling us that we’re not alone, to cherish our families and, speaking of Superman, to be kind.

And every single one of them, without failure, has tons and tons of comments saying how DC is finally back on track and can finally goes against Marvel, saying how they can finally start again their stupid fandom wars. And yes, you could argue that "wars" are part of every fandom, but that doesn't make them annoying to people who just want to enjoy stuff.

What if instead of using the film about kindness to help you revive a stupid war between fandoms and comic books (not to mention that Feige and Gunn have been nothing but supportive to each other), you use the film about kindness TO BE KIND.
