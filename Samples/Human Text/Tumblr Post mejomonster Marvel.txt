I am absolutely desperately craving cherik fics that vapture the MESS that is their history together, their complicated close friends/deeply respectful adversaries who both care a LOT about mutants and want each other to be okay, but want to OVERCOME the other's actions.

I am so desperate that I am diving into the comics again, where I KNOW they're fucking unhinged at times. Their relationship in its original form.

But id also just you know. Love to read some fics specifically focused on them. Just them. ;-;
