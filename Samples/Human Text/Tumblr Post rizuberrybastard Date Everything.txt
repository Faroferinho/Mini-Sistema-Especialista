Honest review of Date Everything

After finding out about the game and being charmed by the character designs and the concept of Friendship being an equally valued ending to Love, I preordered it on Switch eShop and played it the day it released.

After playing through nearly the whole game, I have to say I don't like it.

The designs are still cute and the characters have interesting arcs, but oh my god, this game is excruciating to play in my opinion.

Maybe it's the point (target demographic?) but the person you play as is an insufferable, self-deprecating shut-in loser and so much of the dialogue options reflect that, either self-hate or arrogance. Why would I want to choose to either be arrogant or say I'm a loser?

The game, as is, is full of errors that ruin the player experience. Some dialogue options connect to the opposite responses, and while I was trying to complete the storylines there were ones that I STILL wasn't able to finish due to the clues to the next convoluted step in their storyline not even appearing in the Date-A-Dex.

I will say that I appreciate the Content Aware warnings for potentially triggering characters! Not having to finish the storylines of toxic, abusive, or straight up mean characters is nice.

This is a fun game if you just want to get endings with your preferred characters and that's all. But completionists will probably very quickly be burnt out due to just how many awkward fetch quests are necessary to get the endings to all the characters.

I myself was quickly burnt out, to the point where I might not even finish the game. Props to those who can and did, though. You've got more patience than I do!
