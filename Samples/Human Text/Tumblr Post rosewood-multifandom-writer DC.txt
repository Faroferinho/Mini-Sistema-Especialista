I hope Warner Bros learns their lesson the hard way about bad decision making, because you say “no” to a Batman Beyond movie animated in the artstyle of Into the Spiderverse, but they are trying to make an Amanda Waller show (which I don’t want, as much as I love this despicable and realistic evil character) and made the abomination called Velma. All while having the audacity to announce a Wonder Woman game, only for it to be constantly pushed back, only for it to be canceled.

I will give them this, at least they had the decency to cancel something that isn’t going to work out or become hot garbage unlike whatever it is Marvel is doing with MCU Blade. Like please Marvel, a lot of fans are begging you, just cancel the thing already.
