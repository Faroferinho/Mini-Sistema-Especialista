The Shining (1980) dir. Stanley Kubrick.
7.3/10

About a family who lives at the overlook hotel, which is isolated during the winters. The father is trying to write, the mom is taking care of the family, and the son, Danny, has an ability that helps him understand the horrors of the hotel.

Gives me Russian Ark and all the hotel movies/shows (AHS, Budapest Hotel, etc.), The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover vibes. Also gives me House of Leaves vibes.

I can see how this became a classic. It’s very beautiful. The sound design is very lovely.

Everyone was casted so well. This family looks right and they act well. I honestly think this acting was brilliant.

Poor Dick and Wendy and Danny. They just didn’t really need to go through any of this.
