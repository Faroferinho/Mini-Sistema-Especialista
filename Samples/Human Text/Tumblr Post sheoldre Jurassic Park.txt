Genuinely wondering what the FUCK wizards is on

HALF THE FUCKING SETS???? I DONT FUCKING NEED YOUR FINAL FANTASY BULLSHIT GIVE ME ACTUAL STORY AND ORIGINALITY. Like, secret lair was fine. Nobody was going to be hurt by a walking dead card drop, nobody lost anything to secret lair. In my opinion, the implementation of jurassic park into lost caverns was done great! Rarely, you'd get a collaboration card that was on theme for the set! (same thing with the brothers war thing) But with these new sets this is going to ruin the game. I think that lord of the rings and battle for baldurs gate are fine because of how much the interest overlaps, assassins creed is pushing it, but has fantasy elements that honestly line up with a lot of magic. I also want to make it clear that I'm fine with a crossover set here and there, that can be cool and interesting, but having it be a core part of the game is so fucking stupid. I'm honestly happy for the people who are getting what they want through this, magic is made so people can have fun, not just people like me, but I know that my opinion is shared by other people, and I think that it fundamentally ruins magic to have half the sets be collaborations.
