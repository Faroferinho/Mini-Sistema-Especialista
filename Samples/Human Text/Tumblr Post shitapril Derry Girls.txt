just finished watching "Derry Girls" and i truly cannot remember the last time that i enjoyed a show to this extent.

for a little bit of context, a dash of a synopsis and mostly really something that i can come back to later on, here's what i have to say :

Derry Girls is primarily a teen drama revolving around a group of friends that live in Londonderry, and the lives that they lead amidst the Troubles, a period of great political unrest in Ireland. it wonderfully encapsulates the antics and theatrics that come with adolescence, grossly exaggerates the irish in a way that only makes you more fond of them, and above all still manages to skillfully, sensitively and graciously weave the story of Ireland's hard-fought and bittersweet resolutions of the late 90s into a heartwarming tale of many a lives that otherwise stay nestled in the classes of the economy that are often forgotten.

for a netflix show, the writing and picturisation was commendable. characters had defining quirks and storylines, but without flanderization - a trait netflix teen characters often seem to have. they're humane, they have depth. many a times they're ridiculous and they will very rapidly etch a place close to your heart.

i'm not entirely sure how accurate it is historically, and i'm curious to hear what irish people think about this show and if i'm merely blindsided by the dry humour and the pomp of the 90s, but i for one thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend watching it for a giggle and some warmth and a little dive back in time.
