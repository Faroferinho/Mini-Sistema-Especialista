 It’s really hard to try to enjoy the Jurassic Movies online with so many blowhards griping about scientific inaccuracy and logic holes like this isn’t a franchise about cloned Dinosaur Shaped Manmade Monsters. Like, if we brought back a dinosaur, it would die pretty quickly because the atmosphere is too different, we are in sci-fi territory from go. “But sld, the oxygen levels were close enough-“ this oxygen levels, not a game of horseshoes. If oxygen levels drop by 2% we’d have adverse health affects sooner rather than later, how do you think a dinosaur would handle a 5-10% difference? They’d be brain dead in months. ‘Close enough’ headass-

  it’s a sci-fi series with Dinosaur Monsters! Stop expecting high art and scientific accuracy! Enough high budget dinosaurs! I get the original is a classic, and it earned that title, but it’s not like it’s high art, it’s just a very well executed Monster Movie, it made history for its visual effects, that’s it.

  Anyway, I saw Jurassic World Rebirth this weekend. I actually really liked it. It’s the platonic ideal of a Jurassic Sequel for me, and I’m really bummed that the trend of shitting on these movies is continuing. That so few seem to be willing to meet these movies where they are from a critical point of view. I can’t wait till the movie is on streaming so I can watch it again, the dinosaur sequences are so cool! And the characters are actually characters and not cardboard cutouts, which they didn’t even need to do for me to enjoy the film because I went for the dinosaurs, but I do love that they actually tried this time, it makes it a better watch.
