Shazam! volume 5 is over, but at least we have 7 concurrent ongoing Batman series...

July, 2023â€“May, 2025

this run was delightful and the story was just ramping up, no way was this the planned conclusion, but DC didn't like the sales and needed room for more Gotham books.

I wish dc had faith in other titles, but the people who buy paper copies tend to buy more batman and people who like other heroes often skew into the digital subscription group, and DC only bases future publishing off paper sales, so its infinite batmans forever. and no more shazam for us
