agatha finale rant

so I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of people complaining about the finale of Agatha and I wanted to give my two cents on their main points: Ôøº

1. ‚Äúthey used agatha‚Äôs show as a way to promote a man!!‚Äù well yes! that‚Äôs how marvel tv works im afraid. or any tv, really. wandavision was used to introduce agatha and monica, which led to their projects in the mcu (aaa, marvels). agatha introduced billy, leading to his future in visionquest or his solo series, which will introduce tommy and vision, which will lead to children‚Äôs crusade to reintroduce wanda. this is common for any tv show, but especially a big, connected franchise like marvel. i find it so concerning that even after all the promotion that showed us billy and agatha as co-leads, people were STILL shocked when the finale sets up a future story centered around him. like i hate to break it to yall but marvel wants money. and more shows means more money.

2. ‚Äúthey killed off a lesbian woman and not the gay man!‚Äù first of all, in the comics, agatha is a spirit guide for the scarlet witch. this form is her most comic accurate yet. also, did yall really think that was an unfair ending? or an ending PERIOD? all her death made me think of was the possibilities for the future with both billy AND rio. and again; rio was promoted as the ‚Äòantagonist‚Äô to agatha since the beginning. i don‚Äôt know how people went into this excepting a happily ever after for these two. they were always depicted as tragic lovers, and i honestly think the kiss of death was beautiful and poetic. i also don‚Äôt think this is the last we‚Äôre seeing of rio. and, as a side note, homophobia is still not okay! it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre also gay; lesbians can be homophobic towards gay men, and gay men can be lesbophobic towards lesbians. and i‚Äôve seen wayyyy too much of both in this fanbase. you can criticize characters and critique actors without bringing up their sexuality. we have enough incel homophobes doing that for us

3. if you‚Äôre still complaining about wanda not coming back i have no hope for you

4. this show, since day ZERO, was promoted as a show with billy and agatha as coleads. while i wish we had more backstory for how agatha and rio met, the salem flashbacks involving nicholas, the road scheme, and the song were much more important to the show. the parallels between nicky and billy were explored throughout the season a lot more than agatha and rios story (whether or not you like it, it‚Äôs still true (i personally wish we had a bit more on how they met üò≠))

5. sending hate to actors about things their characters did is STILL not okay! and never will be!

6. this might be a hot take but if you‚Äôre only watching a show for a ship and don‚Äôt care about the story at all your opinion is irrelevant to me. like people who started watching after it was revealed in the show that agatha and rio were lovers (because, correct me if i‚Äôm wrong, this was never revealed before the episodes dropped) have no right to be upset when the show focuses on other things. and this is coming from a MASSIVE fan of agathario. and a lesbian. i loved the fact that i was watching characters who just happened to be lesbians have their own story. yes, i wish there was more agathario in the flashbacks. but i‚Äôm really not upset at all by what we got. and don‚Äôt get me wrong, people have every right to be disappointed, but they don‚Äôt have the right to hate on the creators and actors of the show. that‚Äôs not cool.

this is way longer than i thought it was gonna be üò≠üò≠ hope everyone enjoyed the finale
