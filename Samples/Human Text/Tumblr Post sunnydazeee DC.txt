something that I've noticed about DC fans with Gotham knights releasing is that they don't hate fanfiction, they hate fanfiction written by teenage girls.

any form of fiction written by someone who is not the creator of the original piece of media is fanfiction. your favorite comic writer probably didn't start out writing for dc comics, they probably had to earn their way up in the industry. they had to gain familiarity with these characters, probably by writing fanfiction about them.

the fanfiction that most people see when talking about DC comics is heteronormative, and likely written by young girls who only see their worth in their ability to please a romantic partner. but when they stop thinking this way, they can do great things.

Jason Todd, Tim Drake, Damian Wayne, Stephanie Brown, Cassandra Cain, Barbara Gordon, all these characters that you love? they are all ocs created by fans. the only Batman character aside from batman that i can think of that was actually written by the original creators is dick Grayson, and even then it wasn't just Bob Kane and Bill finger anymore, it was also George Perez. and they were also all created by men, for men.

tl;dr DC fans don't hate fanfiction as a whole, they hate fanfiction because it's seen as being mainly written by teenage girls. most dc authors start out as fans creating media for something they're passionate about, therefore are technically fanfiction creators, but they don't hate that media because it's created by men.
