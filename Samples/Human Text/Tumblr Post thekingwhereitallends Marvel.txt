One common meme people use to bash John Walker and label him as a perfect soldier and no good man is the comparison between him executing Nico and Steve Rogers sparing Tony Stark.

Tony was not going around blowing buildings then making excuses because some lives do not matter. Tony was a hero, even if Steve was opposing his ideology, and was not completely in the wrong. That is unlike Nico, who supported Karli; a delusional girl that believed sacrificing innocent lives was worth the cause she was marching towards. Nico was also so brainwashed that he considered Karli to be a champion of justice in modern era while Steve was symbol of nobility in the past. There is no denying the situation was not the same, and John was also having a mental breakdown over the death of his one and only friend when did what he did, and not a single soul gave a damn about what he was going through at all.

Remember John might have convinced himself Nico was the one who dealt the killing blow to Lemar, but Nico was ultimately assisting Karli in her ambush against John, Sam and Bucky. Nico was also not surrendering at all, merely stalling John and shouting "It wasn't me!" to put the blame off of himself. You can read the body language to understand the decision John made as a soldier who was granted Rule of Engagement on battlefield. The fact that they used John as the scapegoat was due to public reputation of The shield being tarnished, yet the government still found him useful enough that they hired him for another job, wearing another mantle. They still knew John did not deserve such harsh treatment, but no one is ready for that conversation yet.
