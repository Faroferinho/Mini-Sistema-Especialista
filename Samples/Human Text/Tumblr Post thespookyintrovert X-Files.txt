Please let us all shudder at the unimaginable horror that a season 12 would bring about, SCULLY-LESS on top of it all. DD, for the love of Gillian, heed our Dana’s wise words:
Let sleeping dogs lie.

We love this show so much and we die a little inside every time we see it return as a shell of what it once was. Don’t these characters deserve better? You used to be Mulder’s protector and talk about not doing things that wouldn’t be fair to the characters. Well, now is the time to take the last stand.

If CC hasn’t learned anything from S8-11 and a movie, we all know he won’t now. Sometimes saying ‘no’ to our friends is the biggest kindness we can pay them.

Of course, there has thankfully been no talk of a S12 yet, but I dread the possibility with every fiber of my being. From now on, my beloved X-Files, where you go I can no longer follow. Sorry not sorry for the rant, I hope y’all get where I’m coming from.
