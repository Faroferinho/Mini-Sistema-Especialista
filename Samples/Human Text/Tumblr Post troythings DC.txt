ykw?? if the rumors about gal being the dcu ww are true and in fact not copium fakes, then fine. let the general audience have their shitty live action mythos. as a comic fan i don’t care. we’ve waited years for a proper wonder woman adaptation after having that godawful softcore 70s show and the nbc pilot and still they messed it up with snyder’s casting and the movies completely butchering the lore.

if anything this shows that dc still doesn’t care about wonder woman as a character, it’s all about the money. gal is the same she’s nothing without her version of wonder woman so im honestly not surprised there if she’s lying.

“gal gadot gave wonder woman cultural impact”? lmao ok i guess being the ultimate superheroine, UN ambassador, face of ms. magazine and heart of the dc universe wasn’t enough for you live action brains. maybe it’s cultural impact to you because you were finally bothered to get invested in the lore when someone dangled the carrot in front of you

have fun getting locked out of comic lore for the next 10 years lol
