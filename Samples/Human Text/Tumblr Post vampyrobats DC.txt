The Problem Isn’t Robin. The Problem Is You Don’t Like Superhero Comics.

A Defense of Robin & the Sidekick Archetype in Comics.

Every so often, a particular critique bubbles up from the depths of comic fandom discourse: the outrage over Batman’s use of a child sidekick. “How could a responsible adult train a kid to fight crime?”

Let’s get one thing straight right out of the gate: this isn’t a critique of Batman. It’s a misunderstanding or outright rejection of superhero comics as a genre.

Because the idea of a child or teenage sidekick isn’t unique to Batman. It’s baked into the genre’s DNA. Robin wasn’t some edgy, irresponsible afterthought added to make Batman more palatable. He debuted just one year after Batman himself, and was created specifically to give young readers someone to identify with. And it worked;Robin’s arrival doubled Batman’s sales.

Sidekicks Are Genre, Not Anomaly

From Bucky Barnes to Speedy to Kid Flash to Aqualad, nearly every major superhero had a youthful counterpart. They serve multiple purposes: they humanize god-like heroes, ground fantastical adventures, give younger readers a place in the story, etc.

And guess what? Those sidekicks have all endured unspeakable trauma. Bucky died in the war. Speedy dealt with addiction. Wally spent decades in Barry Allen’s shadow. Donna Troy’s origin was rewritten into tragic nonsense more times than anyone can count.

But none of these characters attract the volume of moral panic that Robin does. Why? Because Batman is the most popular, most visible, and most psychologically dissected superhero on the planet. His mythology gets scrutinized through “real-world” logic. So when people see Batman training children to fight crime, they recoil. Not because it’s uniquely extreme, but because it’s more visible.

You Can’t Apply Real-World Morality to Myth

If you apply real-world morality and logic too strictly to superhero stories, none of them hold up. Why doesn’t Spider-Man call Child Services instead of swinging into the night? Why do the X-Men keep putting teens in danger while talking about protecting them?

These stories aren’t morality plays rooted in realism. They’re modern myths, told in the language of drama, archetypes, and symbols. Robin isn’t “child endangerment.” He’s the light in Batman’s darkness. He represents hope, youth, resilience; a symbol younger readers are supposed to look up to, to teach them to stand against injustices and do the right thing. That’s why so many Robins exist, and why they all resonate with different eras.

The Genre Knows What It's Doing

Comics are not oblivious to the implications. Entire storylines have interrogated the ethics of child sidekicks. A Death in the Family let fans decide Jason Todd’s fate. Batman and Robin repeatedly explored the tension of legacy and responsibility. Young Justice and Teen Titans were built on the premise of teens demanding their own agency rather than being side characters in someone else’s war.

The genre critiques itself, but it also embraces what works. And Robin works. He’s lasted longer, sold more, and evolved more richly than almost any sidekick in any medium. If you think Robin is just a tool of exploitation or lazy storytelling, you haven’t been paying attention to the last 80 years.

Admit You Want Something Else

Let’s be honest: most people who rail against Robin don’t actually read superhero comics. Or if they do, they only want a narrow slice of them; gritty realism, moral absolutism, hardboiled antiheroes. That’s fine. You’re allowed to prefer that. But don’t pretend that your personal taste is some kind of ethical stance when the comics themselves do not promote the idea of a teen sidekick.

Robin exists because comics are for more than one kind of reader. Because sidekicks matter. Because legacy matters. Because Batman can’t be a symbol of fear without someone reminding him what hope looks like.
