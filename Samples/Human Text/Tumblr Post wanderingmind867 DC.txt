I've heard that marvel did better in the 60s because Stan lee made his characters more relatable. They had personality flaws and character traits that made them relatable to your average reader. The fantastic four alone had a unique dynamic, and every character feels like their own seperate thing. And then there's characters like Namor or The Hulk, who always had these many facets that make them compelling. And i think DC sometimes had the problem of not making their characters distinct from each other.

Not always, though. Like: Superman and Wonder Woman were always distinct. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster had a pretty well fleshed out character from the beginning, and future writers only built on what they established. And Wonder Woman had William Moulton Marston's brilliant guiding hand. Sure, Robert Kanigher toned some stuff down when he took over, but he had a good enough base that he couldn't anything. Silver Age Superman and Wonder Woman works pretty well.

No, my contention might be with Gardner Fox and John Broome. Those two did most of the characters outside of Superman and Wonder Woman. They did The Flash, The Atom, etc. And those characters are bland in the 60s. No offense to those two men, of course. They did do some good work, but i just think characterization may not have been their strong suit. Because Barry Allen and Iris West feel almost identical to Ray Palmer and Jean Loring, honestly. At least Hal Jordan and Carol Ferris feel a little more distinct. But the flash and the atom are the most boring characters of that era, to me. I don't like Hawkman much either, but he gets a slight pass because i do like his golden age version. I just don't love the silver age one as much.
