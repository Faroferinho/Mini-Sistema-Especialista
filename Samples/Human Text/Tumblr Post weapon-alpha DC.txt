Bruh...There is no way that people are already arguing what "DCU" references in the range of DC stuff. I know the new Gunn led DC stuff is being called the DCU like how Snyder was the "DCEU", but when someone is ragebaiting on twitter about how Ma Kent "cant use a phone but can sew a bullet proof suit"  and someone asks if it was ever stated in the DCU that she made the suit and people reply with panels from the comics (and shows) that she did and someone replies to that with "Those are from the comics not the DCU" and then argue that the comics universe was never refered to as the DCU before the Gunn franchise (which is horseshit because I've heard Writers and Artists call is that for years before there was even a DCEU, I've called it that for almost 20 years) it blows my stack. They call it the new stuff the DCU because they are trying to get the movies back closer to their source material, which is why Gunn keeps talking about specific Arcs and Stories that inspire the new films and shows, Its literally just short hand of DC Universe, you look DCU up on wikipedia and it will have you differentiates if you meant the Comics Universe and the new media franchise.
