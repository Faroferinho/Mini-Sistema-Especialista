Lil rant coming up, just fair warning. Maybe not a rant? idk what it is.
There's just something so amazing about Black Panther and Black Panther Wakanda Forever, and I think that it's because they're both unapologetically black. They're both made with black people in mind and I think that's the most beautiful thing because they didn't hold back when they decided that they were going to make a movie for black people. They made it for black people, not for white people and that's the most amazing thing. Because most of the time when it comes to these movies and pieces of media that are centered around BIPOC, LGBTQ+, or even disabled people it has to be digestible for the people that are not those things and Black Panther didn't do that. It was directed by a black man, there was an album made for the movie by a black man, the main cast was all black, they use African accents throughout the movie. They had to fight for that. I wish all pieces of media that was centered around BIPOC or any minority for that matter did the same thing that Black Panther did. There's a gay story? Make it unapologetically queer. Disabled story? Same thing. Like I think that needs to be the standard for movies or media with minorities in them for them to be truly beautiful, because when you have people in the room that have personal experiences, it makes the media people are consuming more real and it's a game changer. Like with Moonknight, don't just have Jewish consultants, have Jewish people in the cast and in the writing room, everywhere because Marc's character is so closely tied to his Jewishness. There is no excuse because they did it for Black Panther and they do it for white people all the time. It's doable.
It's time they start doing it.
