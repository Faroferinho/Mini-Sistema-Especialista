ive been watching creature commandos and ive been seeing what people are saying about the whole frankenstein storyline and….i think im going insane

eric is the villain here…..so why are so many people acting like hes not….

ive been seeing people EVERYWHERE say that eric is also a victim and thats just not true??????

like yea victor was also a dick but he never stalked and harassed a woman who clearly wanted nothing to do with him while also killing people out of his own insecurity along the way

“oh but eric isn’t as emotionally mature!! he doesn’t really know what he’s doing!!” eric clearly understands the emotional impact of what killing people has and he is very OBVIOUSLY using MURDER as a tool to get what he wants

ALSO he’s been around for 200 YEARS HE HAS HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MATURE EMOTIONALLY AND UNDERSTAND THAT BRIDE DOES NOT WANT HIS ASS

Bride is a person with her own autonomy and her own life and Eric cant see that BECAUSE HES A DICKHEAD
