Something I've been thinking about is how Sonic Adventure's Angel Island redesign unintentionally messed Knuckles over, and continues to affect his usage negatively, even nowadays.

In the classic era, Knuckles leaving the island for short periods of time wasn't a problem, because the Master Emerald was kept in a hidden palace below a volcano.

Even if someone managed to discover the island, locating the Emerald would be another problem entirely.

In order to simplify the story and Adventure Fields, however, Sonic Adventure redesigned Angel island, moving the master Emerald shrine to a mini-island connected to the edge.

This places the Master Emerald about as far out in the open as possible.

(Later the mini-island was removed, and the ME was moved to the edge of the main island.)

This puts it in a position where someone has to guard it at all times. Anyone approaching the island from that side sees the glowing Emerald immediately, just waiting to be stolen.

Because of this, most new Sonic stories that use Knuckles either
A: Intentionally don't acknowledge Knuckles' duties to the Emerald, despite it being unguarded in the open (Heroes, Forces, etc)
or
B: Place Knuckles on Angel Island and refuse to let him move at all. (IDW)

The second case in particular is what we're seeing a lot of now. Frontiers even had to have Knuckles forcefully teleported off the island, because they didn't want him willingly leaving it.

The TLDR is that the classic island works better because the ME is actually hidden.
