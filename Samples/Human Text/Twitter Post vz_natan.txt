I feel like these don't necessarily make the the designs more intresting, but i do think they illustrate the point well enough. It feels like the team was kinda scared to go overboard with the designs of the new Megas, due to how well balanced the old Megas were when it came to being clearly the same pokemon, with just enough changes to be something new that worked, but that kinda lead them to undercooking a little too much, and it's not even that the new Megas are bad conceptually, not all, but it does feel like there were more intresting designs to be made with these same Mega concepts. Now, i will not say that the design philosophy for Megas changed in ZA or anything until i see all of them, but i would be lying if i said there was no "difference" to be felt, i don't know what that is yet, but it's definetively there...
